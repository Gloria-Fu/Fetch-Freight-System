# Fetch-and-Freight-Robots-Scheduling-Simulation-System
We develop a simulation platform with hundreds of fetch and freight robots to evaluate the sechduling algorithms. 

## File list
* CET: The back-end code for the simulation platform with C++ (With the effective approaches we proposed in our paper). The parameter.txt in CET is the input parameter setting, the parameter can be changed according to different simulation scenarios. The folder tasks and goods contains the input goods information and tasks information for 500 rounds of experiments.
* Goods Information: The given goods storage information for three simulation scenarios.
* Tasks Information: The given tasks storage information for three simulation scenarios.
* Interface: Display the simulation platform.
* Video: The video contains the simulation and demo system.
* Results in paper: The total results of the simulations we proposed in the paper.

## How to run the CET progorm
* Windows: Use Visual Studio to open the CET/FetchandFreight.sln, then press F5.
* Linux: Enter to the path of CET, bash solve.sh

## How to run the draw progorm
* Windows: Use IDEA to open the project, change the map and robot path as the path of the currently running back-end program, then start running the program.
